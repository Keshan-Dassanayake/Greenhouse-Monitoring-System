<h1>Greenhouse Monitoring System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This greenhouse monitoring system was developed to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth by leveraging advanced sensor technology. The system uses the BME680 environmental sensor to monitor temperature and humidity and the BH1750 sensor to measure light intensity. Data is displayed on a TFT screen with real-time graphical visualizations, providing an intuitive interface for greenhouse management.

To streamline development, the initial version of the system simulated sensor readings using randomly generated data. This allowed for effective testing and prototyping while awaiting full hardware integration. The project represents an intersection of smart technology and environmental management, showcasing how automated systems can improve agricultural practices.
